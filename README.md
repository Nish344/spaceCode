## How It Works

### 1. Backend (`js/server.js`)

- **Express Server:** Serves static files and handles API requests.
- **/api/question Endpoint:**  
  - Receives POST requests with quiz topic, description, and difficulty.
  - Sends a prompt to the Gemini API to generate a single MCQ in JSON format.
  - Cleans and parses the Gemini response, returning a JSON object with `question`, `options`, and `answer`.

### 2. Frontend

#### `game.html`
- Loads Phaser, the game script, and styles.
- Contains a `<div id="game-container"></div>` where the game canvas is rendered.

#### `css/style.css`
- Sets a blue gradient background.
- Ensures the game container fills the viewport.

#### `js/api.js`
- Exports `fetchQuestion(topic, description, difficulty)`:
  - Sends a POST request to `/api/question`.
  - Returns the parsed JSON question data.

#### `js/game.js`
- **Phaser 3 Game Setup:**
  - Initializes the game with a blue background and arcade physics.
- **Player Controls:**
  - Move left/right with arrow keys.
  - Shoot bullets with the spacebar.
- **Question & Options:**
  - Fetches a new question from the backend for each round.
  - Displays the question at the top.
  - Creates red rectangle boxes for each answer option, falling from the top.
- **Gameplay:**
  - Shoot the correct option to score a point and load the next question.
  - If an option reaches the bottom, the next question loads.
  - After 5 questions, the game ends and shows your score.

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies** (from the `game` directory):

   ```sh
   npm install express body-parser node-fetch
   ```

2. **Start the backend server:**

   ```sh
   node js/server.js
   ```

3. **Open the game in your browser:**

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/game.html
   ```

   > **Note:** Make sure your `images/player.png` and `images/bullet.png` exist, or update the paths in `game.js`.

---

## Customization

- **Change Question Topics:**  
  Edit the call to `fetchQuestion()` in `game.js` to use your desired topic, description, or difficulty.
- **Game Assets:**  
  Replace `images/player.png` and `images/bullet.png` with your own sprites.
- **Styling:**  
  Modify `css/style.css` for different backgrounds or fonts.
